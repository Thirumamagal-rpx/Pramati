- Put appropriate safeguards in place to protect privacy.

## Privacy by default- 
- “privacy friendly” default settings when collecting, processing, or storing data.
- Individuals choice- How much data is processed- default setting- least amount of processing.
- Retention period- default setting- shortest possible retention period.

## Data protection Impact Assessments- 
- Analyses of new processing activities to identify and address privacy risks.

## Individual Rights

- Data Access-
Right to confirm with a data controller whether the organization is processing their personal data
 Must provide the data subject with information about such processing.
- Right to Object -
Right to object processing of  personal data at any time.

```

Three mechanisms that Salesforce uses to facilitate cross-border data transfers:		
Binding corporate rules -
European data protection authorities to facilitate transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA.
The EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield-
These are frameworks designed by the US Department of Commerce, along with the European Commission and Swiss government, to provide companies with a mechanism for complying with European data protection requirements when they’re transferring personal data from Europe to the United States.
Standard contractual clauses(“model clauses”)- 
Legal contracts between parties who are transferring personal data from Europe to countries outside the EEA.

Compliance - act of obeying an order

Preparing for Compliance with the GDPR

Get Buy-in and Build Your Team
Assess your organization
Establish controls and processes
Document compliance

Get Buy-in and Build Your Team:

The first thing any organization can do is make sure its leadership is aware of the importance of compliance with the GDPR
The next thing to do is identify the core team to work on the compliance effort. 

Assess your organization:

Once an organization has assembled its cross-functional team, the team can analyze the organization’s existing privacy and security efforts to identify the top areas of focus.
As an organization identifies where it stores this data, the team can build a data inventory that shows, for each storage system, which type of data is stored there, where it came from, what it is used for, who has access to it, how it is secured, which third parties it is transferred to, and how long to keep it. 
In going through this effort, the team can also identify all the third parties that the organization either receives personal data from, or transfers personal data to.
From the analysis, organizations can create a register of data processing activities, and identify which activities pose high risks to data privacy. For each high-risk activity, organizations can carry out a data protection impact assessment to determine the actions they need to take to ensure that they’re properly protecting individual privacy rights.

Establish controls and processes:

Once an organization has a better understanding of its data, the team can create a roadmap of necessary operational and technological changes. The roadmap can ensure the organization has appropriate controls and processes,
Document compliance:

organization can compile copies of privacy notices and consent forms, the data inventory and register of data processing activities, written policies and procedures, training materials, internal company data transfer agreements, and vendor contracts. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High impact,low effort:

creating a single custom object- High impact,low effort
Building with platform: processes to be noted
Heavy email collaboration
Reliance on spreadsheets
Shared local documents
Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
Impact on only a few departments


Multi Tenant cloud:

Sharing resources.

Salesforce provides a core set of services to all our customers in the multi tenant cloud. No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.

latest and greatest features with automatic, seamless upgrades three times a year.

Salesforce- data secure
Is a cloud service






Metadata:

All of the standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata.

Salesforce knows how to store and serve you that metadata immediately after you create it. - To move fast in platform.


API:(Application Programming Interface)

Allows different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.

Without knowing the details, you can connect your apps with other apps or software systems.  The other details of how the information passes through the system is taken care of by other technologies.

Job of Salesforce in API:
 When you add a custom object or field, the platform automatically creates an API name that serves as an access point between your org and the database. Salesforce uses that API name to retrieve the metadata and data you’re looking for.


Setup Area:

Object Manager
Setup Menu
Main window


Setup Menu:

Administration-manage your users and data. Add users, change permissions, import and export data, and create email templates.

Platform Tools-view and manage your data model, create apps, modify the user interface, and deploy new features to your users.
Manage your code as well.

Settings-Add business hours, change your locale, and view your org’s history.

AppExchange:

Hundreds of cloud applications created by salesforce developers,customers and partners.

Pre-integrated.
Can add functionality easily and efficiently.

Sandboxes:
Sandboxes are copies of your organization in a separate environment. They’re used for development and testing. 


Installing Apps:

first install apps in a non-production environment like a sandbox or Developer Edition org

If you want to limit access to a particular set of users, plan to modify those user profiles before you install the app.

Apps are installed using something called a package.

From Setup, search and select Installed Packages in the Quick Find box.
Click the name of the package you installed. It will be the same name from the AppExchange download page.
Click View Components to see more information about the package.

Data Modelling:
Objects:
standard objects, custom objects, external objects, platform events, and BigObjects.

Standard Objects: Included in salesforce. Like Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity are all standard objects.

Custom Objects:objects that you create to store information that’s specific to your company or industry


Build? create? objects

Fields:

Identity, system, and name fields are standard on every object in Salesforce
Each standard object also comes with a set of prebuilt, standard fields.
Every field has a data type

Customize-->contacts-->fields
Customer fields and relationship -->new

Record Types-->New


Object Relationships:

Object relationships are a special field type that connects two objects together.

Two main types:

Look up Relationship:
A lookup relationship essentially links two objects together so that you can “look up” one object from the related items on another object.
can be one-to-one or one-to-many
Objects in lookup relationships usually work as stand-alone objects and have their own tabs in the user interface.

On the sidebar, click Fields .
Click New.
Choose Lookup Relationship and click Next.
or Field Name, enter Contact and click Next.
Click Next, Next, and Save & New.

Master detail Relationship:
In this type of relationship, one object is the master and another is the detail
The master object controls certain behaviors of the detail object, like who can view the details data.
When you’re creating master-detail relationships, you always create the relationship field on the detail object.

Choose Master-Detail Relationship and click Next.
For Related To, choose Property.
Click Next.
For Field Name, enter Property and click Next.
Click Next, Next, and Save.
Hierarchical relationships:
special type of lookup relationship
The main difference between the two is that hierarchical relationships are only available on the User object.


Schema Builder:

Schema Builder is a tool that lets you visualize and edit your data model
Schema Builder is a handy tool for introducing your Salesforce customizations to a co-worker or explaining the way data flows throughout your system
